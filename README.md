# golang-ci-action

GitHub action that puts in one place a few steps common CI steps for Go project.

Please keep in mind that creating a GitHub action that executes multiple steps and essentially is doing a few different things may not be a good pattern. 
However it solves the problem of having CI configuration source for multiple projects in one single place.
